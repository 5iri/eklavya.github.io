### Project Description

A video card, also known as a video controller, is a crucial component of a PC, designed to enhance the quality of images displayed on a screen. It typically appears as a circuit board that fits onto the motherboard. In this project, we will create our own small video card from scratch, tailored for the by-gone era of CRT monitors, using FPGA technology.
