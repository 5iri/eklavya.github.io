### Project Description


In the realm of high-performance computing (HPC), the demand for faster and more efficient processing methodologies is ever-increasing.
Convolution operations, a fundamental component in image processing often pose significant computational challenges due to their intensive computational requirements.
To address this challenge, our project focuses on leveraging the power of Field-Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs) to accelerate convolution operations, achieving unprecedented levels of performance and efficiency.
Using Convolution as one of the fundamental step for image processing , we will be applying different image processing algorithms on images of varying resolution on a FPGA.
