## Task Description

In the remote kingdom of Arrovia, an ancient tradition has been passed down for generations. Legends speak of enchanted arrows hidden in the mystical Arrow Forest, each possessing a unique power and purpose. 🏹✨ These arrows hold the key to the prosperity and well-being of the kingdom.

As a young and ambitious programmer in Arrovia, you have been chosen to embark on a quest to unlock the secrets of the enchanted arrows. The kingdom's fate rests in your hands as you are tasked with developing a groundbreaking program that can decipher the direction of the arrows hidden within images. 💻🔍

Armed with your programming skills and a deep understanding of image analysis, you set out on a journey to explore the Arrow Forest. The forest is known for its lush greenery, towering trees, and the presence of magical energies that surround the hidden arrows. 🌳🌿✨ It is said that only those with the keenest eyes and the sharpest algorithms can uncover the true nature of the arrows.

Your adventure begins with capturing images of the mystical arrows scattered throughout the forest. Each arrow you encounter presents a unique challenge, as their appearances vary in shape, size, and orientation. 📷🎯 Some arrows are clearly defined, while others may be partially covered by foliage or concealed in the shadows.

To successfully fulfill your quest, you must employ your image analysis skills to process each image and identify the direction of the arrows. You experiment with custom algorithms, exploring techniques to differentiate arrows from the forest background and detect subtle visual cues that indicate their directions. 🧪🔬

The people of Arrovia eagerly await your success, believing that your program will unlock the full potential of the enchanted arrows. The prosperity and harmony of the kingdom hinge on your ability to accurately identify the direction of each arrow and harness their powers for the greater good. 🌟🌍

But beware, as you delve deeper into the Arrow Forest, you encounter mystical creatures that guard the arrows. These creatures, with their enigmatic presence, challenge your skills and force you to adapt your algorithms to overcome their tricks and illusions. 🦉🌌

In your quest, you find ancient scrolls containing cryptic symbols and riddles, believed to hold the key to understanding the hidden patterns of the arrows. With careful analysis and logical reasoning, you decipher these mysterious clues and unlock the secrets they hold. 📜🔓

As you make progress, you uncover the existence of a legendary Golden Arrow, said to possess unparalleled power and wisdom. Finding this elusive arrow becomes your ultimate goal, as it is believed to hold the key to unlocking the kingdom's true potential. ⚡🔑

Can you rise to the challenge and develop a robust C++ program that can decipher the hidden arrow directions, overcome the mystical creatures, and find the legendary Golden Arrow? The destiny of an entire kingdom lies in your code, and the wonders of the Arrow Forest await your exploration. 🏞️🔐

Let the coding adventure begin! Good luck, brave programmer, for the fate of Arrovia rests in your hands! 🚀👨‍💻🔥🗺️

## Task Details

Develop a C++ program that can analyze an image containing arrow symbols and determine the direction in which each arrow is pointing. The program should be able to handle various types of arrows, including those pointing left, right, up, and down. The objective is to accurately identify the direction of each arrow based on the provided image.

- <b>Language</b>: The program must be implemented in C++.

- <b>Libraries</b>: Only standard C++ libraries. OpenCV can be used only for reading and displaying images.

- <b>Image Input</b>: The program should accept input images in common formats, such as JPEG or PNG.

- <b>Multiple Image Input</b>: If multiple images are provided as input, the program should be capable of processing them sequentially and generating the output for each image.

- <b>Output Format</b>: The program should provide the output in a text file, containing the direction of the arrow for each input image.

- <b>Image Size</b>: The program should be able to handle images of various sizes, including both small and large dimensions.

- <b>Arrow Types</b>: The program should accurately identify arrows pointing <b>left</b>, <b>right</b>, <b>up</b>, and <b>down</b>. Other arrow types or symbols are not considered in this task.

- <b>Performance</b>: The program should efficiently process the images, ensuring acceptable processing times for typical images.

- <b>Usability</b>: The program should have a user-friendly interface, allowing users to input either a single image or a list of images and receive the detected arrow directions as output in a text file.
