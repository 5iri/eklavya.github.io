### Project Description

A video card, also known as a video controller, is a crucial component of a PC, designed to enhance the quality of images displayed on a screen. It typically appears as a circuit board that fits onto the motherboard. In this project, we will create our own small video card from scratch, tailored for the classic era of CRT monitors, using FPGA technology.

This project transcends basic learning; it's about developing a sophisticated piece of technology that emulates the intricate video processing capabilities of the golden age of computing.

You'll get the chance to:
- Dive deep into FPGA technology and digital design principles.
- Gain hands-on experience in creating a functional piece of hardware.
- Explore the inner workings of video controllers and how they drive display technologies.
