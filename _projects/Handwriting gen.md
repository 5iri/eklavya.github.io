### Project Description

The project aims to create an ML model that converts given text into handwritten text. We will be exploring many ML techniques and models. The model we will be using is called RNN that allows for sequential data. Our aim is to implement it from scratch including all the forward propogation and backward propogation functions without using any framework like Tensorflow and Pytorch.
