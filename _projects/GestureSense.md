### Project Description

The aim of this project is to develop a user-friendly navigation system for increased accessibility. By utilizing the webcam, the system will enable app navigation and computer interaction using hand gestures. It will employ OCR technology and ML to find alternate ways to convey on screen information to user like text to speech. The system will provide interactive options for users to engage with the content and enhance accessibility for individuals using hand gestures.
