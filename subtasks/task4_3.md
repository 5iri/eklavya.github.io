# Using our knowledge in real life

The simplest embedded system used in real life is car parking system.
So what's the most important thing need to be taken care of in a parking lot?
That's right! We need to make sure only as many cars get inside as the capacity of parking lot.
So let's count how many cars pass thourgh a gate in a parking lot.

## Task Instructions

1. There are two IR sensors one on the entry gate and one on the exit gate.
2. Whenever sensor on entry gate gets triggered Total number of cars is increased by one.
3. Whenever sensor on exist gate gets triggered Total number of cars is decreased by one.
4. Print total number of cars inside parking lot on terminal whenever a sensor is triggered.

Note: 2 IR Sensors will be provided for each team.

## Submission Instructions

- Make a zip file containing<br>
  (a) Your code file (main.c)<br>
  (b) A video showing increment and decrement of total number of cars
