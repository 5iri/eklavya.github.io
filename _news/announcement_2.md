We are really happy to see everyone working hard, and dedicating their efforts to Eklavya. But now its time to shift into sixth gear as there's only 1 Day left for the selections to come to an end.

Eklavya Part 1 ends on 8th July, 11:59PM and so does the submission window.

We will NOT be accepting any submissions post this deadline, so for teams still attempting the tasks, now is the time to pick up the pace!
