## Task Description

Make the design for the leg of a **quadruped** using a **pentograph** mechanism. Simple, isn't it?  
Well, there is a catch: you need to design the leg with various constraints in mind.

> Let the Titan rise.

## Software Required

To be able to perform this task, you will need 3D CAD software, Here are some of the software that you can consider using:

```
SolidWorks (highly recommended)
Fusion360
OnShape
```

- It is not a compulsion to install SolidWorks for this task, but we would suggest installing it as it is industry standard.
- Eklavya is not only about your technical skills but also your approach to a given problem. Similarly, this task doesn't completely focus on your 3D-designing skills but on your visualisation of the problem statement given.
- You can use Fusion360, Onshape, or any other software of your preference except AutoCAD (For obvious reasons ðŸ˜‚).

## Task Details

Design the Legs of the following constraints:

1. Dimensional constraints: The bot should be at a maximum height of **350mm**. The hip joint should be flexible enough to move about **150 deg**.
2. Material constraints: - _Mention your material (e.g., aluminium, high-speed steel, etc., along with the American standards) while submitting the task._ The material must be chosen keeping in mind the requirements of the bot and the stresses it will be under during its work.

## Submission Guidelines

1. PDF must include three views (i.e., top, front, and side) of each **components** used in the **assembly** and then add a general view of the component in it. You can simply do this by creating a drawing based on the assembly in Solidworks.
2. For materials, first state what types of stresses will be acting on the leg you designed (try to display the stress points on the drawing of the assembly), and then state the material and the reason why you chose it. Then, what type of joints are used in your assembly?
3. You can state more than one type of material in the document.

## Judging criteria for the task:

1. The implementation of the theoretical concept of **pentograph**.
2. Design of the components (>=3). Use of different mechanical concepts (Hint: Read this document carefully to understand what concepts you can best utilise ðŸ˜‰)
3. Brownie points for proper documentation of the task

- **Fusion360**  
  Here are the steps to install Fusion360 on your system:

```
  1. Click on the link and sign in to Autodesk using your VJTI email id.
  2. Search for *Fusion 360* and download the file.
  3. Install the software and fill in the details using the same email ID. Apply for **student's licence**. (It will take 24 to 48 hours for verification; then you may start using the software.)
