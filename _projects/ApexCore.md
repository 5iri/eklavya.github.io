### Project Description

Currently AMD’s FPGA synthesizer Vivado uses 32-bit MicroBlaze Risc-V core for its software defined SoC.The goal of this project would be modifying SRA’s present Risc-V 32IM CPU core to replace MicroBlaze soft processor IP.<br>
This will expand the use cases of SRA’s Risc-V core and we can directly use the peripherals and IPs compatible compatible with Xilinx boards to design a custom SoC for SRA around this Risc-V core.
