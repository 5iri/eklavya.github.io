### Project Description
In today's industrial and domestic settings, automation plays a crucial role in enhancing efficiency and productivity. One area where automation can greatly benefit is in the handling of objects, particularly in scenarios where repetitive pick-and-place tasks are involved. This project aims to develop a robotic manipulator system capable of recognizing objects from a video input and executing pick-and-place tasks based on spoken commands.

 We will be designing and developing the Intelligent Video Manipulator with Voice Commands, an innovative system that seamlessly integrates video processing and speech recognition technologies. Our goal is to enable users to interact with and manipulate video content using spoken commands. To achieve this, we will create a robust video input system capable of capturing and processing real-time video from various sources. We will implement an advanced speech recognition module to ensure accurate command interpretation and enable the system to perform specific video manipulation tasks based on these commands. Additionally,We will design an intuitive user interface that provides real-time feedback and controls, ensuring high performance and minimal latency to deliver a smooth and responsive user experience.
