### Project Description

This project introduces a miniature robot capable of scaling obstacles with remarkable precision and agility. The robot utilize cutting-edge sensors, Mechanical designing, PCB designing knowledge and intelligent algorithms to navigate complex terrains, overcoming previously inaccessible obstacles. The synchronized control of motors and flexible chassis design allow the robot to efficiently collaborate and navigate challenging environments. Potential applications in search and rescue, construction, and infrastructure inspection.
