### Project Description
You must have seen the quadruped robots built by Stanford, MIT, IIT Kanpur, etc. These Quadrupeds are way better than the wheeled robots for the navigation and are robust for being used for survellience. Quadrupeds are becoming famous due to their high stability margin and robustness.Through this project, we intend to make a similar robot-VJTI's Quadruped : Titan.<br>

Aim : The project aims to design and build the robot from scratch. Mentees will explore and study various mechanisms to make the robot's leg move, then complete the assembly of a quadruped using CAD modelling softwares like SOLIDWORKS/ONSHAPE/FUSION360 depending upon their conviniece, analysie the feasiblity as well as the strength of their designed parts, manufacture it using 3D Printing and Laser cutting, and simultaneously work on ROS2 for the simulation and the control of the same. <br>
The Quadruped will be then simulated and controlled firstly in Gazebo simulator using the ROS2 controllers, and after this the target is to implement the same on hardware.
