### Project Description

Control systems form the basis for ensuring that every automatic system performs its ordained task accurately, efficiently and quickly (optimally) despite being subjected to varying environmental conditions.
In this project, we will implement MPC(Model Predictive control) on Rotary Inverted Pendulum system using LQR(Linear Quadratic Regulator) as an optimiser.
