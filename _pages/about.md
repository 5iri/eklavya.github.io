SRA had conducted various workshops over the course of this year, starting from Inception till MARIO where we tried to give you exposure to various domains:
C++/Python programming, embedded systems, ROS (Robot Operating System), OpenCV (Image processing), interesting theory (meh) and exciting hands-on hardware experience ðŸ˜Ž
Now, it's time to utilise all the knowledge you gained from these workshops in your own research level projects. 

Eklavya presents you the opportunity to work on projects in various domains where you will be mentored by your seniors over the coarse of two whole months!
Here's the link of all projects with their respective domains.

Whether you are applying for an internship or trying to lit your profile just to brag among your buddies, the level of projects you do in your undergrad life provides you the edge on the same and on top of that, doing a project at the end of the first year itself is a big achievement.

How can we participate in this mentorship program?

Here's the procedure for the program:

1. Logic building and technical round
Here you will get tasks with a defined problem statement and youâ€™ll have to solve it with knowledge you gained from the workshops.
For this round you need a team of two members.
TIP: Try to have a teammate who has access to SRA board as it might come handy for the tasks 
Top performers in this round will go for the next round

2. Interview round

3. Commencement of Eklavya

So, when is the technical round?

First round starts from 28th June and ends on 8th of July.

What preparations should I do for the first round

1. Go through SRA exclusive resources, i.e. ppts from workshops and assignments
Note: assignments will be prioritized in your selections as well, so do attempt all the incomplete assignment s from all workshops

And that's it!  ðŸ˜¤

You need to register for the mentorship program before the commencement of selection rounds with a cool team ðŸ˜Ž
